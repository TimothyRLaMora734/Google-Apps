# Google-Apps
Try this if you want Google Apps in your macOS Dock

# Install instructions
1. Download the .zip-package from https://github.com/tuxedojoe/Google-Apps

2. Double-click the package which will unzip it

3. Drag the applications (Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides and Google Keep) to your Applications-folder

4. To get the apps in the Dock drag the apps you want from the Applications-folder to the Dock

5. Each application will need to get permission to run. So to get Google Keep running for instance; you click the app to get it running but it will complain for security reasons. Then you'll need to open "System Preferences" > "Security & Privacy" and click "Open anyway". This needs to be done for each app, but only the first time you're running it.
